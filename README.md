# Multiplayer Chess Game

Welcome to the Multiplayer Chess Game repository! This project is an online multiplayer chess game developed in JavaScript. It consists of a frontend and a backend that work together to provide a seamless multiplayer chess experience.

## Quick Start Guide

To get started with the Multiplayer Chess Game, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the frontend repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multiplayer-chess-game-frontend.git

# Clone the backend repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multiplayer-chess-game-backend.git
Navigate into each repository and install the required dependencies using npm:

bash
# Install dependencies for the frontend
cd multiplayer-chess-game-frontend
npm install

# Install dependencies for the backend
cd ../multiplayer-chess-game-backend
npm install
Start both the frontend and backend applications using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
# Start the frontend application
cd ../multiplayer-chess-game-frontend
npm start
bash
Copy code
# Start the backend application
cd ../multiplayer-chess-game-backend
npm start
Once both applications are running, you can access the multiplayer chess game by opening your browser and navigating to http://localhost:8000.

Note: If you wish to change the default port (8000) to a different one (e.g., 3000), you can modify the port configuration in the socket.js file located in the backend repository.
