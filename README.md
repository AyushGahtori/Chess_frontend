# Multiplayer Chess Game

Welcome to the Multiplayer Chess Game repository! This project is an online multiplayer chess game developed in JavaScript. It consists of a frontend and a backend that work together to provide a seamless multiplayer chess experience.

## Quick Start Guide

To get started with the Multiplayer Chess Game, follow these steps:


# Clone the frontend repository
```
git clone https://github.com/AyushGahtori/Chess_frontend.git
```
# Clone the backend repository
```
git clone https://github.com/AyushGahtori/Chess_backend.git
```
# Install dependencies for the frontend
```
cd Chess_frontend
npm install
```
# Install dependencies for the backend

cd ../Chess_backend
npm install

Once both applications are running, you can access the multiplayer chess game by opening your browser and navigating to http://localhost:8000.

# Note: If you wish to change the default port (8000) to a different one (e.g., 3000), you can modify the port configuration in the socket.js file located in the backend repository.
